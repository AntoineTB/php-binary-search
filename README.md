PHP Binary Search
=================

This is a composer package which wraps up the algorithm written by Michael King from ([mkwd.net]http://mkwd.net).

By performaing a binary search rather than a linear search, this package provides functionality to perform searches through ordered arrays with greatly imroved performance over PHP's [array_search]http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-search.php
